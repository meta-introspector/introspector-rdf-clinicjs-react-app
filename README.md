# Introspector browser

This project displays and allows a user to browse and interact with a set of data that is available 
via recursive git submodules, so all data that is allowed is built into the base code.
The code that is executed can decide if it allows for more data to be loaded from outside.
So basically we want to point this at some other repos and then call it via urls to load more code.

### Functions

#### Load Datasets

Browse performance result datasets from hugging face and other sources.

#### Run notebooks

Run reports via notebooks

#### Run apps

#### Models

Load different apps and other servlets like streamlit and gradio via safe containers
import other results from other huggingface datasets.

##### Views
create custom displays via iframes.
and display other results from huggingface datasets.

##### Controller
create directory to select results

#### Generate logos and code 

Use ai services to generate logos and html pages for the project, give them feedback,
use autogpt or other tools.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
